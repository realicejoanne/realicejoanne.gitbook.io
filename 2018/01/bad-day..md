# Bad day.

Poor me! Today is the worst day of 2018 so far. In the morning I felt after going to the toilet and then hit standing fan. After telling this to my father, was angry to my mother because he thought I felt after stepped on wet toilet floors. The toilet floors were covered with moss because my mother forgot to clean the toilet. He was also angry to me because I was dumb. Dear God, let me be strong of this accident.

In the afternoon while I took a nap, I got sleep paralysis because of bad dreams. I didnâ€™t really remember about the dream but it was about some people who hated me were making tricks to disgrace me. I was lucky there was a teacher who defended me but I didnâ€™t know why I still got sleep paralysis at that time. After waking up from the nightmare I couldnâ€™t lift my body even my hand. My head was aching and I couldnâ€™t take my favorite balsam to help me better. I was lucky the sleep paralysis wasnâ€™t long. After getting some energies I took my Panadol pill and my favorite balsam to cure me but I couldnâ€™t sleep again after that so I just rested on my bed to make me better.

And now, the worst of all, in the night I accidentally deleted all of my storage in my phone. As you can guess, ALL OF MY MEMORIES WERE GONE. So Iâ€™d already saved a lot of memories, because every six months I backed up my phone memories. But I didnâ€™t know why, maybe just because I was unlucky today, my photos from camera and screenshots werenâ€™t backed up. I thought I backed up everything because in my file history I could check that I backed up my photos from camera and screenshots, but yeah nothing was backed up from the last six months. I also lost all of my photos in LINE chats and only could save photos from the last two weeks. DAMN! It meant that all of my memories I made with some people I love in my third semester were lost.

OMG I WAS REALLY REALLY SAD AND COULDNâ€™T HELP MYSELF TO CRY :\(\(\( Once again, I was so unlucky I couldnâ€™t save my good memories. At first Iâ€™d already lost almost all of my best high school memories in my old phone and I still hoped I could save them in the future because I didnâ€™t have any solutions again to get my memories back until now. And now almost all of my college life memories were lost. Why in the world I could have this problem? ðŸ˜¢ I was thinking to use a software to recover my files but until now I still couldnâ€™t find a good software which could recover all my files without anything left. Please, for this problem help me God! I know there are mortals but I didnâ€™t want to forget those good memories for myself :\(\(\(
