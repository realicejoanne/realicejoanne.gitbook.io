# Too Bad For Dicoding

WARNING: Sad react only.

One day, around the new semester vibe, my lecturers especially Mr. Erick and Mr. Setiawan offered their students to use a free referral code for getting Dicoding classes. There were beginner and advanced Android classes. Dicoding said that this was a scholarship and they collaborated with Google so if we finished the class before the due date, we might get something from Google. Because Mr. Erick shared it before Mr. Setiawan so I used Mr. Erick’s referral code. I actually didn’t take the classes very serious. I mostly skipped the course to make them completed and I only used my brain to do the quiz sections. That referral code only let me did the first two courses of each class so it didn’t take a long time to finish them.

Several days later, I got an e-mail from Dicoding that contained the link to let me got the full access of the advanced Android class. I was also got notified by Mr. Erick since he was my referrer. He wanted me to finish this class for my own sake. I heard that it was only me and one senior in Informatics major who got this chance. Wow, I expected there would be more people got this chance but perhaps my friends weren’t interested with this chance huh? I even offered some of my friends in my gang and some seniors too so it seemed like they didn’t do the first two courses of each class which was the requirement to get this chance. Or maybe they did but the chance was not for everyone who did it.

I had to finish the class before the end of this year. Maybe because of that, I didn’t take this very serious again. I started to finish the class from November. Basically there were three sections I had to complete: the material, the quiz, and the project. There were separated into five parts so I had to submit five projects to Dicoding. Dicoding would review my project submission and I only could continue the next part if my current project submission was accepted.

Each of the project submissions were not built from zero, it was a continuous project that was splitted into four submissions and a simple project for one submission. The continuous project was a movie catalogue app and the independent project was a dictionary app. The order that I had to submit: Movie Catalogue V1, Movie Catalogue V2, Dictionary, Movie Catalogue V3, and Movie Catalogue V4 \(Final\). I successfully submitted the first four submissions but I failed the last one. Dicoding rejected my last project. DAMN SERIOUSLY. They said that I used too many references from other people’s codes. I had to admit honestly that it was true but I didn’t copy them without changing anything duh. I changed the whole UI based on my own design and I also changed the whole variables and code structures. Besides that, how could a project that had been done by a lot of people, including those who completed the class or those who were still in the middle of completing the class, make a lot of differences? I was sure the Java codes would be similar.

So I asked the reviewers by e-mail about the reason why I was rejected. If I was a copycat, should I had been rejected from the first time? This was ridiculous because it looked like that the reviewers played my heart. I struggled a lot from the very first submission and then they rejected me in the last submission. After sending the e-mail, I got the worst response that I really hated to see. They banned me from Dicoding! They blocked my account so that I couldn’t use it anymore for other classes. Basically, I lost all of the awards that I had gotten in the account.

I wanted to cry but it seemed useless. I admitted my failure to Mr. Erick and fortunately he accepted my condition. Well actually I didn’t have to admit that to Mr. Erick as he said before, this was for my own sake. My failure didn’t affect him. I heard that there was also a scholarship for a lecturer and he got one. He was in the event that was held by Google and Dicoding collaboration and I was sure he was there because of that.

My bad. I end this year with failure huh? By the way, you can take a look on my learning progress in my Github repository [here](https://github.com/realicejoanne/dicoding-learning).
