# Title Not Defined Yet

Hello! My name is Patricia Joanne and here I want to tell my story. I’m sorry the title is not defined yet because I still don’t get my job title. In my case, the internship job title. On this semester’s holidays, I want have an internship job since it was also one of the mandatory things to do if we wanted to take undergraduate thesis \(skripsi\). But I still didn’t get it.

I once tried an internship because I was called specifically after winning a competition in GEMASTIK, but I thought I was rejected since I never contacted anymore by the HR. It was my first time visiting a startup office and having an interview. But because I didn’t have any experiences, I failed to give my best impressions at that time.

Luckily my friend Shofi, which was also the ambassador of Glints, suggested me to use Glints. Actually, I already knew Glints as a portal for job seekers but I didn’t know students like me could search internships specifically in that website. After knowing that, I directly made my account in Glints and found a lot of internships to apply. If you don’t have your account, I really recommend to make it in [Glints here](https://glints.com) and complete your account. The profile is very important to fill because the profile will be the first thing that company will check. I filled it as much as I had about myself especially the experiences field. After that I directly went to the internship tab on the website. I really liked the UX of Glints website rather than other job seeking portal websites because of this tab. Searching internships has never been easy like this. I applied to some internship jobs in the website. I waited and waited but some companies rejected me.

I was worried. Was there any thing wrong in my profile? Were my skills not enough for being their interns? I had thought a lot about my past which I mostly spent into organizations and committees. I wanted to improve my soft skills by being busy in organizations and committees. But at the same time, I forgot the purpose of me being an Informatics student. I should have good hard skills too especially in programming, the field that I studied. I realized that I only studied when I had homework or tests. I had been in university but too bad I still had studying mental like a school student.

That’s why I want to change from this time. I don’t want to realize too late about what should I do in the future. I should know what field I mostly like and good in it. We don’t want to work on the field that we don’t like right? Actually, I like almost every fields in Computer Science but I am only good in some of them. I choose UI/UX field and front-end development as the fields that I want to learn a lot now and in the future.

Applying for internship is just the beginning. If I can’t give my best while applying for internship, then I can’t be good enough for getting the real job. I learned that I should balance my hard and soft skills rather than only improve one of both. I want to thank some websites, blogs, and books that I’ve read because I got some good motivations about job seeking especially for Glints’ Instagram. I love the designs of the posts and stories that Glints’ Instagram shared and it made me often checked it out. One of my favorite posts in the Instagram is [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqMD-lGi4ND/) which is a discussion session about a field with some experts and fortunately it is about UI/UX field.

Finally, I got two companies who wanted me to visit their offices on January next year. Wish me luck to get one of those internship jobs! In the end, I want to thank Glints Scholarship to give me a chance to tell my story. I couldn’t tell any tips and tricks about job seeking, or even about career life because I didn’t have any experience in those things LOL. I hope when we meet again, the \(job\) title is already defined yet.

> Well yes this article was really made for Glints scholarship but I lost. I remembered very well that time I was so in hurry to fix some newest blog posts to make this blog didn't look as it was dead.
