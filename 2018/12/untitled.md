# Invisible Committee Record

I don’t know whether to thank Audya or blame him because I was trapped being the head of Communication and Information Deputy in Padjadjaran University Election 2018 or we could just say Prama 2018. Of course I was happy but my mood said no. I did my best with everything matters in designs. I was proud with my resolve to make Prama designs better although the design branding was not as good as CBS because I did the designs as fast as possible without any further plan.

I never showed up in the whole event. I didn’t know anyone in the committee except Audya. I didn’t even know who was the project officer until I heard that the project officer was Audya but he resigned and then someone I didn’t know was chosen to replace him. I barely talked to him about random things and we were only talking if that’s about designs in Prama. I often shared my feelings about my staffs in my deputy that almost no one cared about Prama 2018 as they were forced to do it \(yeah I was forced too actually LOL\). Raihan said that he knew Audya’s problem because he was Audya’s partner in Mathematics and Natural Science Faculty Student Legislative Board, but he said that I should ask him by myself. Although I was curious but my mind was very messed up at that time. If I wasn’t wrong, one of the reasons why Audya resigned was because he was chosen to be the President of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty’s Student Legislative Board next year.

Until the very last day of Prama 2018, I was still being a shadowed core committee.
