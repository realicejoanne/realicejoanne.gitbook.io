# Always Busy

I think I have to write all of my business this semester \(and some of them continue until the next semester\) right now. I started from me as the staff of Literature Division again in Christian Students Community of Misiologi. I had already mentioned a little before. In fact, I wasn’t an official staff because I hadn’t inaugurated yet. I sacrificed that for a position in Himatif a few months before. Beside that, I accepted this duty just because Senior Yoan was the head of this division. I already planned to only have one organization to handle and it was of course Himatif. I forgot if I already told it about that or not. But I didn’t feel disappointed about this duty. Instead I was so thankful I was still trusted by some people. Who cares about a few people who hate me as long as there are still a lot of people who love me. I just hoped this duty would really make me forget my problems for a while. There are Senior Yoan, Igo, Naka, and Grace that will be my co-workers for a year in this division. I will try to love you guys :\*

Second, I also signed up and was automatically accepted as staff of Media and Information Bureau in Himatif. This year’s cabinet name is Symphony Cabinet. And yes, there is a change from department to bureau state. But there isn’t any meaningful difference by changing that. Bureau and department have a same position in the cabinet organigram. There are Reynaldi, Abie, Harris, and Tivani that will be my co-workers for a year in this department. I don’t know what to say about this bureau because I had been already too much talked about this damn problem, I just hope for the best in my department. All of my plans had been broken thanks to everyone who hate me :\*

The last one was the new one. I just got this duty recently. Senior Rana asked me if I wanted to help her in Temporary Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty Students Executive Board as a staff of Media and Information Department. Temporary Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty Students Executive Board was made because there was a problem with the election in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty. I didn’t know the detail so I couldn’t tell anything here. I knew Senior Rana very well so why not? Beside that, she said that this duty was only until the real Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty Students Executive Board was ready. There is only me and her, and also other Temporary Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty Students Executive Board people. I wish this one will be a memorable duty.

So far I only have those duties and don’t want to add more duties. I have to use my precious time in college wisely. Academics and duties must be in the same proportion.
