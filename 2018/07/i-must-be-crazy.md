# I Must Be Crazy

I went back to Jakarta this morning. I woke up at about 8 AM but still didn’t want to separate with my bed until 9 AM. But luckily the traffic wasn’t bad and I could arrive in Jatinangor safely. I spent my first day of arrival with Senior Ojan. I talked a lot with him all day long.

I got a condition from my father to go back to Jakarta again after I finished my Object-oriented Programming 2 final project. Yes, as I told before in [this post](../06/leaving-with-sorrow.md), I had to finish that project. It was just my excuse actually, because I had to do some business in Jatinangor especially for CBS. In this returning, I didn’t bring my new laptop yet because I had to fix my old laptop first to Fajar. But I thought it was alright because I didn’t really need the new laptop this time.
