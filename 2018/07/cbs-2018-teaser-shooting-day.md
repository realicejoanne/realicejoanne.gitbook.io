# CBS 2018 Teaser Shooting Day



Today is the shooting day for CBS 2018 Teaser. I was accompanied by Tole and Luthfi. Luthfi was the actor for the teaser. Several days ago, I asked every CBS 2018 committees to find an actor for the teaser. The group was a disaster. Everyone pointed each other and there was no one who volunteered until Luthfi chatted me personally if the role was still opened or not. Of course I was happy and accepted Luthfi very much. Luthfi was very shy and almost changed his mind but after encouraging him a lot, he was finally sure and be my official actor for the teaser.

I asked my division’s staffs. Ah yes, by the way I was the head of publication and documentation division in CBS 2018. My staffs were Ihza and Ilham. But unfortunately, both of them couldn’t accompany me on the shooting day. There was only Tole, which was the head of the sector 3 where publication and documentation division was in it. So basically he was in higher position than me.

I was not a morning person but for this special day I had to wake up early. I was picked by Tole from my temporary home and met Miau to borrow the camera. Luthfi came after that. At first I thought Miau wanted to join the shooting session but he said he just wanted to wait and didn’t want to go anywhere.

The first shooting place was in Brooklyn which was the place where I borrowed the camera from Miau. It was a place to sit and wait. Sometimes students in Padjadjaran University also used Brooklyn to voice up their events or campus issues. After that, we went to uphill road of love. Well, that’s the name and don’t ask me why it was named like that. The third place was in Rectorate of Padjadjaran University. Yeah, it was really far from the second place so Luthfi borrowed Miau’s motorcycle to go up there while I was picked by Tole’s motorcycle. And finally the last shooting place was in our beloved studying place: PPBS. In English we could say Basic Science Service Center. We were just done and suddenly I remembered that we should take scenes too from a bedroom. Too bad that Miau should go from Brooklyn so we had to say sorry to him because we had to use the camera more than the time that we promised.

After that we went to Tole’s temporary home to take the bedroom scenes. And hurray! It’s finally done. We didn’t go back to each other’s temporary home directly but we watched a movie from my harddisk. It was because Tole asked me to borrow the harddisk to copy the videos from Miau’s camera and he took a look my harddisk. The movie that we watched was “Salah Bodi” which was already watched by me. It was an funny but ironic movie from the old time of Indonesia when everyone didn’t get easily mad because of the genders and religions. I could think if the movie was launched on cinema this time, it should be banned because the theme was very sensitive right now.

And yeah the day was over. Luthfi came back to his temporary home and so did I. Oh my, I forgot to tell the story of the teaser. So basically Luthfi was a freshman of Informatics student in Padjadjaran University and he got a riddle message from CBS 2018 official account. The first clue made him to go to Brooklyn. The next clue was found there and it directed him to the uphill road of love. The next clue brought him to Rectorate and the last clue brought him to PPBS. In PPBS he got an envelope with a QR code and when it was scanned, he would see a flashback video of CBS 2017 and an invitation to wait for CBS 2018. The plot was actually revised a lot because I was very shy to show off this idea. All CBS teasers from the time when I was a freshman until the last year, were always only giving flashbacks of the previous CBS. I thought it was too mainstream so I suggested this idea. But at the same time I was afraid the video would take longer time and too boring. Thanks to Tole which helped me to edit the video so I could be focused on other jobs to do in CBS 2018. The video can be seen below.
