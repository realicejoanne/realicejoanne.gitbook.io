# Imazine 5

Imazine was one of my favorite work programs of media and information bureau in Himatif. Last year, I was chosen as the editor in chief of Imazine 4 and this year Imazine 5 was launching. To be honest, I didn’t like the editor in chief of Imazine 5. He didn’t work hard like me last year. I couldn’t complain a lot since I only became the head of documentation section and my only one staff was Dimas Satria aka Tole. Like I always did in the last year, I collected the completed series of all the documentations from Himatif’s work programs and Tole picked the photos that would be used in the magazine. This year’s theme was very cute though. “Ohana means Himatif”, because Ohana means family. Since Ohana things was related into Lilo and Stitch vibes in Hawaii, we were using tropical theme in the whole magazine and mostly designed by the design section head and staffs. I had to admit this year was not as well prepared like last year’s but we uploaded the magazine on a perfect date and time without being panic with the due date of our recess time.

Here’s the magazine to be enjoyed!
