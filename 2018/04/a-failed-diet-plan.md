# A Failed Diet Plan

I think I donâ€™t grow anymore since I was graduated from junior high school. Yeah, junior high school. My height and weight donâ€™t change. But my body isnâ€™t ideal. Some people said that I was too short to be chubby. I donâ€™t think they were wrong.

I donâ€™t remember when I got this fat belly. I thought it was already there since I was born LOL because almost of my family members had it so I thought it was my family genetics. But it was wrong! My youngest sister doesnâ€™t have it. She is the smallest in my family. She will be graduated from her primary school next year but she still looks like a five years old girl. I am very envy to her ðŸ˜ 

I wanted to diet. I planned it and I bought everything I wanted to eat in a week. I bought wheat bread, yogurt, apples, low fat milk, a big box of oatmeal, slice cheese, a box of green tea pouch, some sachets of instant cream soup, and a bunch of pasta. Now I wanted to review them all.

The first menu is a sandwich which was made from two loaf of wheat bread, cornet, and a slice of cheese. Itâ€™s really not recommended guys if you donâ€™t have a fridge because cornet canâ€™t be survived for a long time if it is already opened. You need to save it in the fridge to keep it fresh. I also was so stupid because I directly ate the cornet without cook it. Itâ€™s edible but still itâ€™s not good for health. I didnâ€™t know how to cook it. I only had a rice cooker in my room and I failed to cook the cornet in the rice cooker.

The next menu is a bowl of oatmeal. I mixed it with corn flavored Energen and yeah itâ€™s totally delicious. Without any toppings, the oatmeal was very plain. I actually wanted to make another oatmeal mixes because I was easily bored eating the same food everyday. Beside that, I was also too lazy to wash a bowl every time I finished eating so I only rinse it with water \(Warning: not to be imitated\).

I also tried mac and cheese. Oh my gosh, it was the worst of all the menus Iâ€™ve tried. I followed the recipe from the internet which was only needed a rice cooker, milk, macaroni, and cheese. But I failed. The problem was I used slice cheese. I should try that with mozzarella cheese. Well, I am so done with pasta cooking. I only could make instant spaghetti with instant sauce. I will try pasta cooking again when I have my own kitchen. In fact, mac and cheese is literally my favorite food right now and I failed that ðŸ˜« I even didnâ€™t touch for a little and just threw it away. All I did was just making the rice cooker dirty.

Beside trying some diet menus, I also had apples, yogurt, green tea, and cream soup. Oh yes, the green tea was suck. Itâ€™s not like matcha flavor in any food and drinks. The green tea was very bitter. Was that because I didnâ€™t add sugar? But if I added sugar then it wasnâ€™t a diet plan. I was also too lazy to have it in a glass so I used plastic water glass instead. Again, itâ€™s really not recommended because you canâ€™t use plastic for hot drinks.

I think thatâ€™s all I tried for my diet. The reality is far from my expectation. I assumed that I failed this diet plan. I only did on a week and couldnâ€™t survive for a month. I couldnâ€™t reject when my friends asked me to eat together. First, I could. I didnâ€™t want to eat rice since I had already eaten oatmeal. I also avoided chickens as much as I can. But after that, I surrendered. So sad.

NOTE FOR MYSELF \(and also to readers\): DO NOT TRY HOMEMADE DIET PLAN IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO WASH DISHES. BUY A PACK OF DIET FOOD AND DRINKS FROM ANY DIET AGENTS.
