# Collecting Coins \(FREE CRYPTOS WITHOUT INVEST NOT CLICKBAIT\)

If I’m not wrong, today is the first day of me trying to understand about bitcoin and other altcoins in cryptocurrencies. Actually I hate everything about business since I am really bad in it. But this one is different. Ah yes, this post was not made on this date LOL. I just had to made it on this date because I wanted to remember the beginning day of my struggles.

Because I didn’t like business, I was only told about how cryptocurrencies worked by Senior Ojan. He wasn’t an expert of this business but he was already an old player. He said that he already knew bitcoin since three years ago wow. He told me a lot about the basics especially about trading but I wasn’t interested to do trading because trading had a lot of risks beside making us gain profit. I prefer…COLLECTING COINS. There were a lot of cryptocurrencies faucets and miners that gave you coins for free. I knew some people would say, “WTF so stupid.” or whatever because it would take a long time to collect them until you became rich. But I remembered that there was a proverb said, “Little by little till to be hill”. So I believed maybe in the end of this year at least I could collect some for my pocket money.

But I had many problems about faucets and miners. Internet was not always honest. There were legit faucets and miners, but there were also scams. Be aware to them, especially miners. Right now I haven’t find a legit miner that is mining because there is none of miners I am focusing that I can withdraw. I am not really into miners since I had already tricked by two sites at the same time ☹️

As long as I knew, the one and only way to find out if they are scams or not is googling it. Fake miners usually don’t show their team’s identity. Or if they show it, the photo of their team is photoshopped \(This is so sad but it is true\). Legit miners usually don’t give anything for free even though it is for limited time or free but take a long time. You have to deposit so you can mine. There is also a free way, but you have to sacrifice your PC to mine. I mean, it mines based on your CPU strength.

So far I haven’t tricked by fake faucets on internet. I found some but they were Android apps. Android apps are more difficult to google if they were legit or scam. But they weren’t difficult to guess. Leave every faucets that make you claim too high. I prefer faucets with low withdrawal amount. Also I really recommend you to use FaucetHub. FaucetHub provides a lot of faucets and also auto faucets too which are 100% legit. So if a faucet site says that you must have FaucetHub account to withdraw the claims, it’s legit of course. But still, again you must be aware if the withdrawal amount is too high. By the way I’m not really sure about this umm in FaucetHub you can make your own faucet but maybe it’s just for premium users idk.

In this post I will share a list of legit faucets and miners that I can proof it with my withdrawal history. Please use my referral code okay, thank me later.

> No, I'm too lazy. Don't expect me to update an old post. Besides that, I just check that some of the websites and apps are already dead. Well, figure it yourself if you still want to collect free cryptos.
