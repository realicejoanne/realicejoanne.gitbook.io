# I Just Don't Want This Month's Empty

OH wow I can't believe that I didn't write anything in this month. Well actually yes but there are protected rants and I am too stupid to remember each of the passwords. Basically those rants were about me who were falling in love and talking honestly about my rotten generation Cyber 2016 my generation but yeah forget that.

I won't let this month be empty so I will replace the contents that should be my rants into another rants LOL.

In this month, I was not as free as it's like but I had to deal with a chess competition again in [Instagram 2018](../04/bye-instagram-2018.md) and I was busy as a secretary for [Technopreneur 2018](../../2017/11/tech-in-asia-2017.md). COIN was held too in the middle of Instagram as usual and I was delegated to join the infographic design competition again. But since I was not being serious and the stricted rule of the competition was too stupid so I didn't know what to share or what to say about this. Can you imagine that you have to design but you have to prepare the assets before the competition and you are not allowed to search and download additional assets? Even a professional designer can't do that. The time limit also didn't make sense. So yeah too lazy to write a long review about that.

Oh I also struggled for a head position in IFest this year but the project officer didn't choose me. That's why it made me wanted to write rants about my rotten generation before. Instead of getting a head position in IFest, they made me became the head of publication and documentation in CBS 2018. I won't tell a lot here, you could read that in [this post](../08/august-notes.md).
