# Food &gt; Project

Today was really epic because Shofi and me were working until midnight in Upnormal restaurant. It was because we had to finish a lot of final projects as soon as possible. There were Computer Network project, Artificial Intelligence project, and User Interface Design project. I was in the same team with Shofi for Computer Network and Artificial Intelligence project. We also invited all members in Computer Network and Artificial Intelligence project team. Not only that, Shofi invited some members in her User Interface Design project team too. But I didn’t. It will be another story in other post about [that](http://blogs.unpad.ac.id/realicejoanne/2018/06/05/user-interface-design-project/) LOL.

We worked very hard for those projects. During working, we also having some snacks and food which was paid by Shofi. Wow she was really royal at that time. Just because she wanted everyone came so she planned to pay her team members. It wasn’t meaningless. Our meeting today was very worth it.
