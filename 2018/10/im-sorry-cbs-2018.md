# I’m Sorry CBS 2018

Today should be the last day of CBS but I have to say sorry I couldn’t join you guys. I believe on my staffs to get the documentations of the last day. I know people behind me are saying bad things about me because it’s like I ran away from my responsibility. Some parts of me will say that’s true, but that’s not the main reason. I already fulfilled all of my responsibilities through days of CBS this year. Almost nobody respected on me so why you guys envy me because I have to focus on GEMASTIK? It’s not like GEMASTIK stuffs are easy as you guys thought. I liked my jobs in CBS but I hated the committee members. I trust all of you will do the best although I couldn’t see them by myself.
