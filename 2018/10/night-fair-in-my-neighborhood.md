# Night Fair In My Neighborhood

There is something unique in my neighborhood. It’s like the Annarasumanara vibe but in low budget I think LOL. In Indonesia, it is called “night fair” or “pasar malam”. You can find the amusements that you usually see in the amusement parks. You can buy cotton candy, catch fish, cheap clothes stands, and many more. I would like to see some games stands with some prizes to win but there wasn’t one in this night fair haha. This night fair is not always here, actually it is just here for several days and I believe they will move to other places.

I was trying to go to that night fair today along with Senior Ojan, Senior Bob, Senior Piya, Senior Tyara, Senior Gilang, and Senior Muriz. First met in Pondok Kemuning, then we got there together.

We have to pay about eight thousand rupiahs for each amusement. Since I didn’t know the name of the two amusements we tried, I couldn’t tell it here sorry. The first amusement looked like a ship which would be swinged up and down several times. The second amusement was like the merry-go-round but more extreme. We sit on the edge of the plate and the plate would spin and go up and down at the same time. Man, the first amusement was very tiring but the second one was the worst of all. I hated the second amusement a lot because there was a big high-volumed speaker playing remixed annoying songs. Every time the plate went down, my ears were about to break because of the speaker’s volume. At the same time, I wanted to throw up because it was spinning like crazy without any alert that it would be stopped. I meant, any alert such as making the plate slow down.

In the end, we bought cotton candy and went back to each other’s temporary home. It was quite worth\(?\) I don’t know. Ten thousand rupiahs for a big cotton candy that even two people cannot finish that cotton candy \(because it was too sweet, damn\).
