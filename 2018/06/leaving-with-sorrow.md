# Leaving With Sorrow

A day before I went back home I still took some time to travel to Bandung with Senior Ojan. Unfortunately, he didn’t go back with me to Jatinangor. Actually I was really sad and even cried in the travel car. But I couldn’t force him because he had another business with his family.

And today I got back to my not-so-lovely house in Jakarta. I really want to go back as fast as possible because I won’t stay long in Jakarta. There is still a final project of Object-oriented Programming 2 subject and it needs to be presented to the lecturer. I wasn’t lying, it was true but the lecturer gave us convenience by letting at least one of the team was there to present it to him. In fact, my parents said I should stay for some days in Jatinangor rather than went back to Jakarta faster. But I didn’t like that idea because I didn’t want to be a burden for the temporary home guardians. They also wanted to go to their residences like us because they wanted to celebrate Eid al-Fitr with their big families.

The journey didn’t take a long time. Usually it took about 4-6 hours to reach Jakarta but today it only took about 2 hours! Wow so unbelievable. I wanted my father to pick me up but because he didn’t reply my messages so I got back by myself to the house. Unfortunately, there were no one at home because everyone in the house were in the supermarket. So I waited for my family to go back from the supermarket and yeah it was really boring and annoying because I couldn’t sit without being noticed by people who were crossing my house.
