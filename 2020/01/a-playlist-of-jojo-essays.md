# A Playlist of JoJo Essays

Here’s the list of my JoJo rants.

{% page-ref page="jojo-1.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../02/jojo-2.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../02/jojo-3.md" %}

This post is actually not made on January 17. I put that date so that this post will be posted before the first part of my rants about JoJo. I know this is unrelated to my college life. This act could let me do something stupid again that I will regret later so I promise I will only review JoJo. I won’t review IU, Allie X, Katy Perry, 1D, HC Andersen, RL Stine, Junji Ito, Yakitate!! Ja-Pan, Sims Freeplay, Rusty Lake, Ghibli, Marvel, or Star Wars. To be honest I share my rants about JoJo because I want to stop thinking JoJo for a second. By expressing what I think about it in writing, I will find peace. I know this is curable like when I obsessed with IU, Allie X, Katy Perry, 1D, HC Andersen, RL Stine, Junji Ito, Yakitate!! Ja-Pan, JoJo, Freeplay, Rusty Lake, Otome, Ghibli, Marvel, or Star Wars before.

God, please lead me so that I won’t fall into the old obsessions or bear any new obsession. I almost fell into Yakitate!! Ja-Pan obsession again lately. I need to stop and focus on my duties to graduate!
