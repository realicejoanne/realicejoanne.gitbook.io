# Still Instagram 2017: Me in Chess Tournament

Umm okay so today I am delegated from my generation to play chess for Instagram competition. Just reminder, Instagram is one of Talent and Interest Department’s program which is a grand competition between generations in Informatics Engineering Department. One of the competition is chess. Let’s go to the story.

Actually I was so sleepy but I had a duty for my generation tonight. I waited for a long time since the end of the lectures today. I didn’t understand why my battle still didn’t start in that time. Did I wait because my opponent still not coming? Or because there weren’t any chess board available?

Finally my battle started. I was lucky because I got the white pieces so I could take turn first. But unfortunately in the first round I lost because my turn time was out. Yeah so in this battle every chess players got 15 minutes only to take turn. But it was my fault I didn’t stop it when I finished taking my turn.

In the second round I exchanged my pieces into black pieces. Honestly, I wasn’t good in using black pieces. The game was still going and I was getting more hopeless. But miracle happened. I won with only one piece: my king! Of course I won not because I could checkmate but my king couldn’t move again. In chess rules it was called ‘stalemate’. Actually it’s a draw, but in this battle it considered that I won. LOL. In that time I was happily crying because of that moment. I didn’t believe I could win with that way OMG.

Now we went to the third round because me and my opponent temporarily got 1-1 score. Shortly, in the third round I got white pieces again and my power increased and win the round with the truly checkmate. Yeah I won this game and entered the final soon.

This day was really an exhausting day for me. For about 6 years I never played chess and suddenly forced to play it again. Hello chess my old friend, trauma you came back.
