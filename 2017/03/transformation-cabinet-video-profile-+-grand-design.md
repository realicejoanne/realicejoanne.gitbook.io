# Transformation Cabinet Video Profile \(+ Grand Design!\)

Remember the Grand Launching event of Transformation Cabinet? Finally I finished the video profile. SERIOUSLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I TRIED AFTER EFFECTS. Luckily I got a few help from Senior Rifki for the opening and closing so I didn’t have to continue use After Effects for the whole video. Believe me or not, I made 90% of this video using Wondershare Filmora! Please check this out!

I know it’s boring but yeah I don’t care. I’m tired. I only had three days to post this.

And this one the grand design of our cabinet that I’ve ever mentioned before. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6t6iEnfwpaTWXhpcFJ1UlBINTQ/view?usp=sharing) for viewing!
