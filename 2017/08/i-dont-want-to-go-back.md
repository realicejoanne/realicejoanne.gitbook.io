# I Don’t Want To Go Back :\(

Finally I came back to Jatinangor. Before today, I struggled a lot with my father because he didn’t want me to came back fast. Yeah me too. But there will be jobs here so I didn’t want to miss them.

Yesterday, I packed all my things. Then I slept faster than usual. LOL I had to admit I felt like American while in Jakarta. Slept in the morning, woke in the night. I hoped in Jatinangor I was tired enough to be sleepy at night.

And today I went to Jatinangor along with my father. He helped me brought my things to my temporary home. We went at 10 AM and arrived at about 3 PM. Well, such an exhausting day so after I cleaned my room I slept for a while.

At night I woke up and did an useless activity: WATCHING SLEEPING BEAUTY. Damn, why this story was so stupid -\_- Fuck fairy tales who always told about handsome prince and beautiful princess. Then I slept again.

Ah yes, at first I was disappointed to be here today because the Character Building Season meeting wasn’t tomorrow. But luckily, there would be another meeting in MIPA Bersatu tomorrow so I didn’t have to be in my room uselessly.
