# IndonesiaNEXT 2017

IndonesiaNEXT was another boring seminar that I went just for killing my free time. But this time I was taking courage because the free time I had should be my time to study for Numerical Method midterm test. Luckily, there was a leak of the test from class B which was doing the test at that time so I still could study in the seminar by answering the test. Pssttâ€¦ Please keep this secret ðŸ˜¨

In the seminar there were lots of my acquaintances I knew from my department and some other departments. That was because this seminar was recommended by Padjadjaran University itself. The seminar was soooo long and it almost took the Fridayâ€™s shalat time. Thanks to the seminar I got lunch to eat. I thought I could go back to my temporary home for preparing the midterm test but I was afraid it could take a long time so I just directly went to the classroom where the test would be taken. The test was going easily for me.

After that I was having quality time with Senior Ojan. I meant quality time which was ended with quarrels. Then I went to Growing Faith Team meeting but we just talked randomly not about the materials. Finally I went to my temporary home and finished my problems with Senior Ojan. I was so sorry with him, I shouldnâ€™t get mad on him and instead I had to support him for Inscape in the next two days.
