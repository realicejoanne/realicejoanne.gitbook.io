# Mentoring the Juniors

Today wasn’t really a special day but I just wanted to tell this story because this one was new for me. Finally my mentoring team got a free time to do mentoring for the first time. The mentors were me and Senior Sylvia from Chemistry Department. The mentees were Agnes from my department, Lidya from Geological Engineering Department and also Anette from my department. Anette was a friend from my junior high school but she didn’t go to college because of her sickness so she wouldn’t join our mentoring time for this semester. We started the mentoring session with praying then go to the materials and the last was sharing time. I had to admit that mostly Senior Sylvia who lead the mentoring session rather than me.

I remembered how I was trapped in this mentoring team. Long long time ago when I just started this third semester, Nathan asked me to be a mentor. Well, I accepted that because I thought I only became a backup person. But in fact, I was included in mentoring groups, partnered with Senior Sylvia. At that time I was a little bit disappointed because my mentoring group was contained unknown people except Agnes. Honestly, I never met Senior Sylvia before today’s meeting and I was glad she was nice and not bad for a mentor.

So far, I could tell that this experience wouldn’t be awesome but not bad. I like Senior Sylvia and also Agnes is here for me. But I don’t like Lydia. We had a LINE group chat but Lydia never talked in the group even when she was mentioned or asked. Senior Sylvia and me should contacted her via personal chat to get her answer. Such an apathetic girl. Even in this morning I had to reconfirm her attendance via personal chat because she didn’t tell us if she was on the way to the meeting point or not. I wished she could be better by days because I didn’t want my days be bad by waiting her replies.
