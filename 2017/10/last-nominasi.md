# Last NOMINASI

Did you remember NOMINASI? If not please check out the [first](../03/nominasi.md) and the [second](../05/nominasi-part-2.md) NOMINASI story before. Actually it should be 4 times but I didn’t join the third because I was busy with something that I didn’t remember.

Today’s NOMINASI was different from all NOMINASI that we ever held. If usually we only had forum about how media and information was going in every department, this time there was a workshop about how to make a good poster design. The speakers were coming from KGF \(Kelompok Grafis Fikom\) or we could say Communication Science Faculty’s Graphics Group. Even though I was the event organizer along with all Media Department staffs, I also listened to the materials that they brought. And wow, there were lots of theories about making good poster design I just knew today. So far I only made designed with only my feelings. When I saw it’s good, then it’s good. After KGF people finished the materials, Senior Rifka continued it with his tutorial about how to make a guideline for poster templates. Senior Rifka was one of Media Department staffs too like me. He was also my role model in Informatics Engineering Department because of his designing talents. I wished I could be like him so I could be a good next head of Media and Information Department.

Finally it was over and we all took photos together. Then I went back to my temporary home to prepare myself before going to State of The Art Fest from Law Faculty. I went there with Senior Ojan but when I arrived in the venue, I suddenly cancelled to go inside there because I didn’t want to go myself without Maria with me. So I sold my ticket to Abie and his friends and I went for a random trip in Bandung with Senior Ojan instead LOL. I was so sorry to him because I brought him for nothing there.
