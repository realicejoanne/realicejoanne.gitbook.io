# The Evaluation and Award for Executive Board of Himatif Part II

This month would be the last month for Impressive Cabinet leading Himatif. Just about nine days again and we were going to recess. Today we were having another evaluation and award program again for the Executive Board. As I guessed it would be late again from the plan so I chose to spend my time talking with Senior Ojan before going there.

Same as the part I that you could check [here](../05/the-evaluation-and-award-for-executive-board-of-himatif.md), every departments told all the programs and its evaluations. Other departments could add more evaluations or maybe appreciations and suggestions. My own department didn’t have a lot of evaluations like the previous part but there was a big problem with us: we lost a precious staff here. Senior Cipto had been busy for a long time and he was almost doing nothing for this department. He also never went to any of Himatif programs. He was being active too far for university but not in his own department. My department also got a suggestion from others that we should change media and information department into bureau instead. Why we had to lower our pride just because we didn’t have a big programs like other departments??? I didn’t understand.

After the evaluations, we went to the next agenda. Yes, it was the awards time. There were awards for three categories: staffs, head of departments, and departments. For the staffs categories I was being one of the nominees of the drama queen girl but I didn’t win it. It was Afifah. The funniest moment was when Senior Ojan became the most caught red-handed \(tercyduk\) guy in Executive Board just because he was having lots of time with me. I had to appreciate the Organization Development Department for organizing this program. This part was better than before. All the winners got not only snacks as gifts but also a certificate and a pin. What a good idea. After the awards time finished that we took a photo together and went back home each other.
