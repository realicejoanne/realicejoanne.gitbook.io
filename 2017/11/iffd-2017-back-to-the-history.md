# IFFD 2017: Back To The History

IFFD or Informatics Fun Day was a celebration of Himatif’s birthday. Himatif’s birthday was on December 22nd but we celebrated it now because on December we were already having holidays in each other home LOL. This year theme was vintage and guess what I just wore a casual plaid shirt and jeans. I was lucky the theme wasn’t difficult so I didn’t have to borrow dress like last year’s IFFD.

This event was held on night so I had some time to finish my homework first. When I arrived at the venue, it was raining and I was a little bit cold.

In this event there were lots of performances, including singing performance and magic show from the lecturers. I had to admit I didn’t have a lot of interests in this year’s IFFD. It was so regular even my own generation performance. Just before my generation performed, I was asked to be a cameo while I didn’t understand what they performed in stage. Thanks a lot there were free foods I could taste while being bored with the performances.

I became interested when the mixed generations performed. The story was really simple but funny. Better than all performances before. After that there was also Vivicu aka funny videos show. Some of them were funny, some of them I didn’t understand the jokes. The last performance was from all of the Himatif leaders from the first cabinet until now. They brought a poem beautifully and powerful. That’s all I experienced in IFFD this year. I hoped next year would be better.
