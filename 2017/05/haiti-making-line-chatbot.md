# Haiti: Making LINE Chatbot

Haiti is one of the programs by Research and Development Department. It’s a special workshop for IT soft skills and it’s only dedicated to all Himatif big family. I joined this program because I found it exciting. As you can see on the title, we would make a LINE chatbot in this workshop! And the fact was it’s not only me who found it exciting. The room for the workshop was very full of people even some of my seniors didn’t get any more seats.

Okay so let’s talk about the workshop. The presenter was Tony Haryanto, the Co-Founder and CIO of Codepolitan.org. At first I could follow the instructions and finally finished my chatbot. But unfortunately, because the presenter forgot to insert some files in the toolkit so I failed. In the other side, if I used Google Chrome browser then edit the files using Postman maybe I could finish my chatbot. Ahh it’s okay, I wasn’t disappointed at all because I had already learned something new today even though I couldn’t finish it. Thanks Research and Development Department!
