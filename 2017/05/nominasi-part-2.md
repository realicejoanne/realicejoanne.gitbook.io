# NOMINASI Part 2

Do you remember NOMINASI? If not, then you had to [read this](../03/nominasi.md) first. Today me and other Media Department from Transformation Cabinet executed this program again for the second time. We still have two times more to execute this year.

In this meeting, I didn’t come late and could join from the start. The agenda was sharing problems and business then last one was awarding for the best media department. When it came to share everyone’s problems and business, Senior Cipto as the representative of Himatif told a lot about Senior Algif. As one of Himatif’s representative too I also told about him. OMG we shouldn’t talk bad things about our head of department. But in this moment we really needed the head of department’s affect. Some of our programs were uncontrollable because he rarely followed them up. Luckily, Senior Tiar and other media department representatives gave a lot of good advice about our problem. At least, the silence of the meeting could be filled by discussing about our problem LOL.

Then it came to awarding agenda. The best media department from our first meeting until today was Kappatheta. The representative from Kappatheta at that time couldn’t attend so Senior Yuli accepted the award. Actually she was from faculty’s media department but she was also from Kappatheta even though not its media department. The award was so simple but beautiful, it’s a bunch of paper flowers made by Senior Wiwi and a bar of chocolate. That was for the end of our meeting today. Actually I had a Himatif Database Apps project meeting which place was in Senior Cipto’s temporary home but that annoying dude left me because I still had to gather with Senior Tiar and other faculty’s media department staffs to evaluate this meeting. Luckily Senior Tiar wanted to take me to that place.
