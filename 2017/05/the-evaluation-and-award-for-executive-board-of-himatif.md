# The Evaluation and Award for Executive Board of Himatif

It’s been about three months that we, Impressive Cabinet, had already led Himatif this year. And that’s why we needed an evaluation so we could make Himatif better.

Actually today there was also a program by Cabinet Resources Bureau from Transformation Cabinet. The name was Mentoring if I wasn’t wrong and the program was about a meeting between Transformation Cabinet and Exciting Cabinet \(WTF? I don’t know the right word for “seru” in English\). The Exciting Cabinet was a cabinet of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty’s Student Executive Board in 2016 so that meant they were before Transformation Cabinet. But I chose to join Himatif Executive Board Evaluation Program instead. I was so unlucky because actually I could attend both of the program. This evaluation program was late from the plan. And in the other side, the mentoring program was started on time and finished when the evaluation program was going to start. Yeah, at least I could sleep a lot in the checkpoint room while waiting for the evaluation program started.

The agenda was so simple. All departments, one by one, told their completed programs and the evaluations. Other departments could add some evaluations too. How about my department? Umm actually we didn’t have any problems with our programs but we really need more bonding between us. Our department group chat didn’t have much conversations and the chats were usually boring. Also as the people who shared information we should be fast to respond so they wouldn’t be any miscommunication or belated posts.

After the evaluation, we were also celebrating Senior Hilmi, the vice president of Impressive Cabinet, who had a birthday several days ago. And then we came to the next agenda: the Executive Board Awards. There were a lot of award categories which I didn’t really remember. And guess what? Hell ya, how in the earth I could win the most talkative person in the cabinet???!!! Okay at least my department was happy we got a bucket of snacks as the gift.

That’s all for today! Whoa, I didn’t expect this program would be ended in midnight. Oh yes, I forgot to tell that this was one of the program by Organization Development Department. Thanks a lot for today and I wished for the best for my cabinet especially my own department teehee.
