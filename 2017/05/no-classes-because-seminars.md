# No Classes Because Seminars

Sometimes I felt thankful I was in this university because the lecturers were really understanding us LOL. Yeah, that title wasn’t wrong, today all of Informatics Engineering in Padjadjaran University were skipped classes because we should attend a seminar in Dipati Ukur. The seminar was from Huawei and talking about IoT or Internet of Things. By the way, the venue of the seminar was as same as Technopreneur’s several days ago so it brought up some memories to me. Oh yes, by the way I got here by using bus from the rectorate and it’s all free.

I had to be honest that I didn’t pay attention with the seminar because it was boring. But in the end of the seminar, it came to be fun because there was a doorprize for lucky participants. The doorprize wasn’t that cheap, it was mobile phone so I thought whoever who got that was so lucky.

After that, we got free lunch and went back to Jatinangor using the bus again. My bus was arrived on time with Mrs. Mira’s seminar. Mrs. Mira was my guardian lecturer \(dosen wali\) and today she was being the speaker of an Online Business Seminar in Bale Sawala, held by Students Council of University. I might be not getting free snacks and goodies but at least I got a certificate to collect yay. That’s all for today.
