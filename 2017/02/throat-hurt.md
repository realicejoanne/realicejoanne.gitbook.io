# Throat Hurt

Since yesterday, my throat hurts.

I didnâ€™t know why, there was no indication for cough or flu. My voice was also fine. I ate well too yesterday even though I ate noodles cup only. OMG why??!!

Now I canâ€™t swallow food well. Every time I move my tongue, it hurts. The worse of all, I pee several times. LOL I donâ€™t know if this is related to my throat but itâ€™s really annoying. I imagined there were some evil bacteria lived in my throat huhu. Usually throat is infected by bacteria right?

Actually I promised to myself to go to campus today for Great Deliberation of Himatif but I didnâ€™t go because I thought I got fever. Todayâ€™s foods were porridge and curry lontong only. I chose them because I knew both were so tasty and didnâ€™t need to chew since I canâ€™t swallow well.

Itâ€™s already two days but Iâ€™m still hoping for magic. I hate to eat medicine. Not because it tastes bitter but I donâ€™t want to waste my money buying it. So I only drink ginger formula of Tolak Angin which is already available in my medicine box. But there are only 4 sachets so I hope in 4 days I will get well ðŸ˜·
