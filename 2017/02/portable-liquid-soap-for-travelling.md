# Portable Liquid Soap For Travelling

Want to travel somewhere but don’t know how to bring your liquid soap? Maybe it looks stupid but I swear it works!

I will have two night gatherings in a row, Himatif’s and my generation’s so I need to bring my liquid soap but the problem is the liquid soap bottle is too big and I’m afraid it will be spilled in my bag. So I pour some liquid soap into a small bottle of mineral water.

It’s not only for liquid soap, but you can use this lame trick too for shampoo!

Haha okay that’s my new life hack. Ignore my advertising language. Wish me safe and sound while going to those night gatherings!
