# Fight For You

Finally today I could go to my temporary home again in Jatinangor. Actually the plan was cancelled twice, February 1st and 5th, because there were some troubles in my house. Umm… I’m really sad to leave my house in a bad condition. My father was fired and everyday argued with my mother. How could I leave my house like that? And actually both cancelled plans were going to my temporary home with my father but finally today I’m going alone.

All of my packages had already prepared since February 1st so I didn’t worry forget to bring my things. I had already rechecked them too. Seriously when I came back home I only brought one bag but now I had to bring two bags.

So today after my father accompanied me to Primajasa bus stop, I was left alone in a bus. Sat exactly behind the driver and couldn’t sleep for a second. Seriously I didn’t understand why it took so long times to reach Jatinangor. The bus that I took didn’t pass the toll but the public ways. That’s also the reason why I didn’t know where would I arrive. There wasn’t any kilometers sign like in the tolls.

At about 3 PM, I finally arrived in Jatinangor and I hadn’t eaten my lunch yet. I couldn’t eat or drink properly in a bus you know. Then I took a public car for getting my temporary home. AND THIS ONE WAS THE HELL FOR ME. The driver of the public car I took didn’t want to go until he got his public car full of passengers. No, not just full but very dense\(?\) until I couldn’t even breath inside. I was squeezed between my heavy bags and passengers. In that time, I swore a lot in my heart. Damn you greedy driver!

In the middle of the way to my temporary home, I took off from that damn public car and took another public car. This one was lighter than before. After reaching my temporary home, I took off again and finally slept like a dead man in my room.
