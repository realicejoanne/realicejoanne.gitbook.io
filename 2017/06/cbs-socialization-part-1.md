# CBS Socialization Part 1

Itâ€™s been a long time since I never asked Ibnu to pick me up to campus again. But today I went to campus with him because there would be CBS Socialization Part 1! CBS is derived from Character Building Season, a student orientation program in Himatif for new students. Ah yes, I havenâ€™t told about this before. Every year there will be two big programs by Himatif, there are CBS and IFest or Informatics Festival. The two youngest generations should take at least a job between them, but if there is someone want both, itâ€™s still welcomed. And if there is someone donâ€™t want both, itâ€™s still okay too but he/she will be loss of new committee experience.

This year I chose to join CBS committee. Actually I even didnâ€™t want both but as I said above, I would be loss of new committee experience. Thatâ€™s why I thought one was more than enough. I was so sorry to Senior Ojan that I rejected his offer to join IFest committee. I just didnâ€™t want to make myself dying. I had already joined six committees including CBS for the sake of God! And if I count my four projects too then I will have 10 duties to complete. I hope everything goes well. Please God help me ðŸ˜­

Back to the topic, all CBS committees had to gather today because we would present a socialization for Himatif big family. Thatâ€™s why I went to campus today with Ibnu because he was also CBS committee, the academic division to be exact. And I was one of medic division in CBS. Actually I didnâ€™t get this division as I wanted. I wanted to be serious by choosing publication and documentation division or event division when registered myself for this committee but Senior Arie, the head of medic division needed girls the most so I surrendered myself to be medic division. In fact, there wasnâ€™t any female registrant in medic division so Senior Arie requested Hilya and me to be in medic division.

So today I could say our socialization was a big success after practicing in three meetings before. But this wasnâ€™t over yet, there would be the second part of CBS socialization. Actually after CBS socialization, there was Himatif Iftar \(buka bersama\) but I didnâ€™t join because I wanted to meet up with Shofi so when it was over I directly went to our meeting place.
