# Scholarship Seminar & Prepare For Future

Although today is Saturday but I had to wake up early. No, not because Instagram again. But I want to develop myself \(self-imaging only aka pencitraan :p\) so I can have a lot of certificates for showing my pride LOL.

Today there were two events that I joined. The first one was Scholarship Seminar which was launched by Geology Engineering Students Executive Board. I knew this info from someone in Transformation Cabinet. Several days ago, she promoted it in the cabinetâ€™s group chat. I saw itâ€™s interesting because itâ€™s free and included e-certificate. I re-promoted it to my generation group chat and luckily there were a lot of interested friends who wanted to join it.

The second one was Prepare For Future which was one of the programs by Professions Department. Honestly I didnâ€™t intend to come to this event. I just joined at the first then left even before the event started.

Okay okay letâ€™s start from when I woke up. Damn, today was so hot and it made me lazier to walk. But luckily I had Hilya who also hadnâ€™t prepared. So we met in front of Padjadjaran University and walked together to the venue. This was the most tiring morning ever since I was in Jatinangor, even more than Instagram. Believe me or not I walked from my temporary home to Bale Santika only with my feet! On Saturday there werenâ€™t any public transportation inside Padjadjaran University. And when I wanted to go to the campus, there was traffic jam on the road along my living place so I had to walk instead waiting for public transportation or ojek.

After arrived in front of the venue, we decided to check PFF first. At that moment, the event hadnâ€™t started so we chose to go to the scholarship seminar instead waiting for PFF. Luckily even though we were already late for 3 hours, we still could go inside to join the seminar. But we chose wrong seats because the air conditioner didnâ€™t reach our seats so we couldnâ€™t focus anymore to the talks.

Finally when the seminar was over, we came back to PFF event. By the way PFF had two event activities which are talk show and interview simulation. The talk show was about world of work and itâ€™s opened for every generation in Informatics Engineering of Padjadjaran University, but the interview simulation was only for Assembly \(2014 generation\). When we came back to PFF, the talk show was over and some of Technopreneur committees sold McDonaldâ€™s fried chicken for getting money. Umm I also was one of Technopreneur committees so I had a sense to help the sales by buying one portion of McDonaldâ€™s. After eating my McDonaldâ€™s, I went home with Hilya and Bening. By the way, today Bening had an event with her community unit \(UKM\) in the same venue with PFF thatâ€™s how we met up ðŸ˜€
