# Comparative Study from Brawijaya University

Today is a special day for Transformation Cabinet because our friends from Brawijaya University came to do comparative study with us. Why did I mention friends? Because they were from the same faculty with us, Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty. Just the difference was they didn’t have Informatics Engineering and Electro Engineering like us :p

The venue was in Statistics Department hall and I went there together with Mila. When we reached the venue, the event hadn’t started yet so after leaving our bags in the hall we got out to search for breakfast. Unfortunately, we couldn’t eat our breakfast because Brawijaya University’s people had already came.

The event started by singing Indonesia Raya then each of us introduced ourselves. As usual Senior Lukman and Senior Yulian as the president and vice president of our students executive board introduced about us by using my edited video from the grand launching. LOL I always wanted to laugh every time I watched that. Then it’s Brawijaya University’s turn to introduce. They were using powerpoint presentation. At that time I saw a lot of differences between us and them, especially they only had a few departments but each departments had a lot of staffs. Just info, we have departments separated by each sector so although we have a lot of departments they are still controllable by the head of the sector.

After that we had a FGD \(focus group discussion\) which was grouped by each sector/departments. Me and other departments from Information and Relation sector were grouped with Media and Information Department from Brawijaya. We talked a lot about programs and shared how we worked on students executive board. Then we took a photo together and came back to the hall. In the hall we ate our lunch and went back home. But I couldn’t go back with Mila because it was raining at that time. So we waited for the rain and using free WiFi there.

When the rain stopped Mila and I didn’t directly go home but searching for some snacks so we could eat them during we did our homework. We bought pinch cake \(kue cubit\), seblak, and bubble tea. That’s all for today.

PS: Next week, we will get another new friends coming from Indonesia Islamic University but I can’t join because… You will find it later :p
