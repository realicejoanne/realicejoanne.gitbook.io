# Such an Exhausting Day

Door to door. Is that a game? No. It’s a nightmare.

Today all of Technopreneur committees woke up very early because we would head to Bandung. It’s not for traveling but it’s for selling foods! We met in the same meeting point and went to the venue together. If I wasn’t wrong, we would head to Batununggal. When we arrived, each person should have a partner to sell a box of snacks for fifty thousands rupiahs by asking door to door. That’s why this strategy of selling was called door to door. It’s not the first time this strategy was used, the first one was for IFFD committee so at the moment some IFFD committee alumni were being nostalgic today. I became Iyon’s partner but we both failed to sell a box. Not only us, but there were a lot of who failed too. But not a few who succeed selling a box, even more than a box. Ahh I didn’t feel the fun of selling like this.

After that we were allowed to go home. But Abie and me had a plan to buy properties for computer organization and architecture project. The project was for our midterm exam score so we had to do our best. We went to Jaya Plaza which was recommended by Senior Cipto. And we were also accompanied by Angga, Iyon, and Vega which also used this chance to buy the properties. After we got what we needed, we were going back home. By the way, we didn’t get an USB cable for connecting the circuit to electricity so I suggested Abie to solder the USB cable by ourselves.

The plan was we were going back home and then in the afternoon we met again in lab because Angga had a key from Senior Yoza the lab assistant to enter the lab. But unfortunately Abie seemed like breaking my solder which I had already cared for about 4 years. So at the end we decided to borrow the USB cable from the lab until the day of showing our project came.

In the lab we also failed to test the circuit. I thought it’s because we didn’t buy the right switch button or the microphone component. Until night we still couldn’t find the bug so we went home for nothing. By the way, 90% of the project were made by me :p Abie only helped setting the components and bought all of the properties so I didn’t have to worry about my money :p Luckily he was a good friend of me so I didn’t hate it all.
