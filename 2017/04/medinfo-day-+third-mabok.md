# Medinfo Day \(+Third Mabok\)

Although it’s Sunday but I still have an activity to do. Today the Media and Information Department of Himatif had a meeting or we could say today was Medinfo Day for us. We met at 10 AM in Himatif checkpoint, the secretariat room of Himatif. There were me, Iyon, Senior Cipto, and Senior Piya. Guess who wasn’t there? Yes, the head of the department itself, Senior Algif! Huh, while waiting for him coming we were unclearly doing something like editing the organigram design and the rules of checkpoint board. Why I said unclear because until now we still didn’t know the concept that Senior Algif wanted. I wanted a theme for the designs like the last year’s theme which was Pacman or greenish decoration like Senior Cipto suggested but Senior Algif rejected them all. By the way, I had already told you in previous post about how late we were replacing the organigram and other decorations in checkpoint. We should already do this since a long time ago. Ahh I really hate this situation.

Back to the topic, Senior Algif had something to do before met us today. He said it was more important than us. Haha, I don’t hate him but I thought he should know his position here, we were already waiting for him for 5 hours for the sake of God! Yes, he finally came at 3 PM when suddenly Senior Tiar called me to made the third Mabok.

At 4 PM Senior Rifka picked me up and I couldn’t continue my organigram design again so I left my laptop and other things I brought in the checkpoint then let Senior Algif did the rest. Me and other staff of Media Department in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty Student Executive Board didn’t take a long time to make the Mabok of the month. The concept was my idea, it’s about chalk zone so Senior Tiar printed some chalk sketches for the design. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of the wall magazine. I had to admit, this program was always a disaster for Media Department every month. Although we were already cover the wall magazine with a big plastic and also changed how we setted the contents into using push pins, the wall magazine still would be messy at the end. Also I thought we never really completed wall magazine because it always had some space for missing or forgotten contents to add.

About less than an hour, in the middle of setting the wall magazine contents Iyon chatted me to take my things because they were already going back home. What?! Seriously? We only met full-team for a while? What’s the meaning of Medinfo Day ☹️ Okay I was seriously disappointed with this but what could I do? I could only type in this blog.
