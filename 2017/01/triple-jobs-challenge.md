# Triple Jobs Challenge

On December 16th 2016, I was appointed to be a part of Misiologi. Misiologi is derived from MIPA-Farmasi-Geologi \(Mathematics and Natural Sciences-Pharmacy-Geological Engineering Faculties\) and it‚Äôs an organization of Christian Students Community from those three faculties. In the past, there were one faculty but now there were separated. If my department is also separated into Engineering Faculty, will the name change again? LOL forgot it. In this organization I got position as a staff of Literature Division.

Then on December 26th 2016, I was accepted as a staff of Media and Information Department in Himatif Executive Board. Himatif is Informatics Engineering Students Association. By the way, Himatif has three parts of organization, there are Executive Board, Legislative Board, and Great Deliberation Presidents. Damn, it‚Äôs truly difficult to describe in English. Those three in Indonesian are BE \(Badan Eksekutif\), DPA \(Dewan Perwakilan Anggota\), and Presidium Mubes. I won‚Äôt tell a lot about the job descriptions of them, coming soon okay. Oh yes I forgot to tell that I got same division as Iyon woohoo. I even wanted Abie and Rey too got Media and Information Department but unfortunately they didn‚Äôt üôÅ

The last one, today I got myself in Students Executive Board of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty aka BEM Kema FMIPA as a staff of Media Department. This one was the only one I didn‚Äôt really desperate to get because I‚Äôve already had two organizations to contribute. I signed for this open recruitment because Mila signed and also Alif and Ihsan from Ocho Cinco. But unfortunately Ihsan wasn‚Äôt lucky.

Alright, that‚Äôs all the three organizations that I have to contribute this year. Honestly, those three jobs that I have are the same. Literature Division, Media and Information Department, and Media Department have the same job descriptions: doing designs and controlling social medias so I think I won‚Äôt be rush take care those three. Wish me luck guys. I hope those three also don‚Äôt make me stress and still have good scores for this semester.

OMG I forgot this one. I don‚Äôt know what kind of job is this, I was chosen to be Mrs. Mira‚Äôs assistant for completing her master degree thesis. Wow I‚Äôm so confused but also happy. Why did Mrs. Mira choose me? I‚Äôm a freshman who barely know anything. Yeah I hope this one also doesn‚Äôt disturb my college life.

Okay bye. Once again, WISH ME LUCK PLEASE!
