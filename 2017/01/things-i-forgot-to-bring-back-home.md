# Things I Forgot to Bring Back Home

You know, because I came back home too early so I have a lot of things I forgot to bring back home.

Why the hell I forgot to bring my money??!! Of course I know itâ€™s okay to leave it but without money I canâ€™t go anywhere I want. My Jakarta friends were asking me for going to watch movies and going to mall but I couldnâ€™t. Yeah it doesnâ€™t really matter too since Iâ€™m too lazy to do something outside my room. Haha.

This is the worst thing I forgot to bring back home. The tablet! I had almost gone crazy because without the tablet turned on I couldnâ€™t activate my Indosat number. LOL I even made the customer service of Indosat overwhelmed with my questions in Twitter. Luckily, I could save my Indosat number from the death. Thanks to all customer service of Indosat ðŸ˜„

Then I have 3 bottles of Minutes Maid that I never drink because I canâ€™t open the bottles. I should bring back home actually for asking help my family to open them. I hope those drinks donâ€™t be expired while Iâ€™m in Jakarta.

While I brought some of my clothes to ask my mother to wash them, why the hell I forgot to bring my towels??!! Seriously those two towels I have in temporary home were never washed for about 4 months. And Iâ€™d rather choose to bring my clothes? Damn stupid me.

The last one I think itâ€™s important to bring back home is my pair of flat shoes. Without them I only can go anywhere with shoes. Itâ€™s more comfort wearing flat shoes than shoes but yeah they were already forgotten to bring back home.

Hoho okay thatâ€™s all. I hope when I come back home again in June I donâ€™t forget again to bring those things.
