# Born To Protect

Born to Protect was an event for all Indonesian hackers\(?\) LOL I didn’t really know well. I joined this event because I was invited by Senior Ojan to come. Fortunately, at that time I was free so I accepted his invitation. I went to the venue which was in Bandung by a public bus called DAMRI with him. It was my request to him because I wanted to try something new not as usual which always used motorcycle.

We arrived just in time with the start of the event. I wasn’t really focus to the event because the venue was full of people and I couldn’t see the materials clearly. And I chose to spend my time to read Webtoon instead of listening to the seminar. After that, there should be a hacking competition but I didn’t join it. I went to malls to eat and also glasses shops to accompany Senior Ojan buying new glasses. At that time his glasses were broken and he used his old glasses right now. But after checking many shops, he didn’t buy anything because the price was too high haha. Finally when the sun was down we got back to Jatinangor and reached each other temporary home.
