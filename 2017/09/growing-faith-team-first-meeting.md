# Growing Faith Team First Meeting

Growing Faith Team is a small group contained 4 people inside, there are Senior Friscil, Viona, Ruth, and me. Actually I had already known Viona and Senior Friscil because we were in the same mentoring group before. At that time Senior Friscil was our mentor and now in this Growing Faith Team she became our mentor again.

Today was the first time of Growing Faith Team meeting. This group was already made since I was in second semester, but we were very busy at that time so the first meeting had just started from this semester. We decided to meet up in Ruth’s temporary home at 4 PM. But because I had a meeting with Media Department from Transformation Cabinet first, so I came up late.

In our first meeting, we talked randomly before we started to the serious topic. Then we got two new module books for our material during “Growing Faith” time. And for today we only discussed the first chapter from the first book. After that we were praying together for our business, health, family, and time. Finally we got back home each other. I really had a good time with them and I wanted to meet up again, but as we already knew I was super duper busy in this semester with a lot of committees jobs. I wish I could meet up again even though it’s only once.
