# See You Later Jatinangor

Yeah finally I go back to Jakarta today. Hello again my house! I miss how noisy my family and how messy my old room is. I also miss my mother’s homemade foods so I don’t have to eat more chickens again like in Jatinangor. This time I didn’t forget important things to bring like previous trip. But I was disappointed I went back too early to my home while some of my friends were still in Jatinangor.

Actually I had already planned to go back to Jakarta on December 23rd because I wanted to celebrate Christmas Eve with my family. But because there was a problem with 2015 and 2016 generation’s final term test which used Computer Based so the lecturer wanted to redo the test on December 31st. I was forced to celebrate Christmas Eve in a church in Bandung. Luckily there was Senior Yoan who accompanied me. It was my first time seeing her after I had my [gloomy week](gloomy-week.md). I told her the true story of my gloomy week and she gave me lot of messages that I should be strong and believe that there would be another good plans for me. The plan of redoing the test was cancelled just after I already celebrated Christmas Eve. Some of friends were lazy to go back home even after heard this announcement but different with me, I directly packed my things and prepared to go back to Jakarta in the next day or today in this story.

In Jatinangor, some of my friends were planning to have BBQ time and sleepover party. Ah I wished I didn’t go back today. It was no use I went back to Jakarta faster or not because the Christmas Eve was passed and my family was already celebrated it without me.

I also had two competitions projects to do in this holiday time. The first one was Technovation category in Arkavidia competition by Bandung Institute of Technology teamed with Eko and Zaenal. The second one was Game Development category in MAGE competition by Surabaya Institute of Technology teamed with Senior Rio and Senior Midun. I thought it was better if I made the project in Jatinangor because I really needed good internet connection. Ah it was my fault. I didn’t want to regret anymore but just want to enjoy my family time here.
