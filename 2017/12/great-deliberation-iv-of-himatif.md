# Great Deliberation IV of Himatif

It was still in my [gloomy week](gloomy-week.md) and I couldn’t smile again after being broken heart yesterday. On December 2nd until 3rd, the Great Deliberation IV of Himatif was held. In the venue I only focused to my web development project instead talked with some friends. Whenever I had to talk with friends I gave them my fake smile. I hate you guys, it wasn’t easy for me. But what could I do to them? They didn’t know my feelings right now.

The event went slowly but smooth. I thought it would be horror like I saw on last year. At that time, my department also didn’t have any big problem to be a long discussion with Himatif family. There were only small problems that even staffs could answer.

I liked the free foods served by the committees. It wasn’t bad for minimum budgets. They even had more foods left. I took two times for lunch. It’s not because I was hungry, it was Raihan who made my first lunch spilled off. At night, as same as last year’s, the committees didn’t give free foods again. So I went to McDonald’s in Cibiru just for eating ice cream LOL. Ice cream was really my stress cure.

Overall, on the first day of the Great Deliberation we were discussed all programs in relax with Himatif family. When the discuss was over, all Executive Board people could go back early.

The next day, or we could say today, I arrived very late to the venue. The Executive Board scoring was already over. My department got A grade with 80,75 as the final score. Each of my programs score were 68 for WoI, 77 for CIA, 88 for Imazine, and 90 for Impression. Beside that, my department became the 5 best departments in the Executive Board. What really a good news to hear!

I only came for a while today. After taking my free food I was planning to go somewhere but because Paquita and friends needed me to edit their Operation System project video, I couldn’t refuse it. While the Great Deliberation still continued, I helped them.

Today is the last day of my gloomy week and also the last day of me living in Senior Ojan’s temporary home. It’s not that I already forget the gloomy memories but as long as nobody reminds me, I will be okay and do activities as usual.
