# Cacti Monitoring

This final project had actually nothing special to say. I just wanted to thank Bening and Shofi for being a good team during this semester and finally we could finish the Network Management subject with this final subject. It was basically codes using Cacti. To be honest I almost didn't understand anything since I usually helped on the documentations instead of trying Cacti by myself. Bening was a student with Computer Network as her interest and she was our team's big help to understand this thing. I felt lucky that I chose this subject as my minor subject this semester because I felt no worries on my final score.

To get a look on my final project, you can visit [this repository](https://github.com/realicejoanne/manjar-project) in my Github. Hope it will be helpful for anyone too.
