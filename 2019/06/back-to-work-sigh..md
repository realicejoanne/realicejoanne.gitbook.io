# Back to Work, Sigh.

I just arrived in my hometown on Friday and I had to go back to work at the Kargo office this Monday. Sigh.

I felt so weird because the office vibe was very different. There were so many new employees and also summer interns. I had two new teammates from product design too, they were Ilham and Ivdur. I met Ivdur in the lift. Ah yes by the way I got to the office with Maggie by her dad’s car. Maggie didn’t tell me a lot about what’s new at Kargo but she helped me to get to know some new people there, including Ivdur who met us in the lift.

On my first day of the second season, I also met Tiffany. I was surprised with her real aura even though I had already talked with her on Whatsapp. I was interviewed by her about what I wanted to do in this season. I told her I wanted to expertise my design skills. I was also given some e-books to be read and summarise. Oh wow the e-books that she gave were awesome. I thought I would get bored because I rarely read non fiction books but I felt the authors were explaining like a teacher. Superb!

Although I was tired on this first day, I hope this season will be as great as the first season. Ah I felt so happy too because Ino remembered my birthday today and some of the old Kargo employees that already knew me congratulated me as well. Tiffany and the other product design team didn’t notice it but well I understand that we just met today.
