# Shape and Color Detector using EmguCV

To be honest, I didn’t really think too much about this project. Once I knew how to deal with a programming project, I would choose that way. I didn’t say that I didn’t understand anything about image processing and analysis but sometimes the lecturers were very annoying. They asked us to make a project in a very short time. This project was one of them. I didn’t want to waste my time to build a new project because I knew my skills were not as good as the people on the internet.

Thanks to Nezio, the person who worked on this project, I could reuse his project and make a better version of it. I fixed some bugs and redesign the UI. This was actually a very basic but detailed project. We can detect shape and color using this program. Check the [project](https://github.com/realicejoanne/pacd-project/) in my Github as always!
