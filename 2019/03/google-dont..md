# Google, Don’t.

Google, I don’t understand why did you contact me in this friggin’ bad time.

I was so happy when I saw my Google internship was responded and that person who sent it asked me to schedule the interview time. I even told my parents about this and they congratulated me even though I wasn’t accepted yet. I was actually worried because I applied for Software Development field and the office that I chose was in Singapore. I applied that for a long time, around November last year, but Google just responded me at the time when I was already in the middle of college study. I hated when my father said that I could leave my college study just for this internship. It’s not that I didn’t want it but it’s the wrong time now. Aside from that I still wanted to try my best.

Today was the interview time. I was interview by the person who sent me the response e-mail before. She was a woman who worked in recruitment team. I was interviewed using Google Hangouts. Of course, that’s one of Google products haha. I was so stupid when I once thought the interview would be using Skype which was one of Microsoft products.

The first interview question was to introduce myself. And then she directly asked which programming language that I preferred. I said C++ because I was too dumb and that programming language was the only one that was taught in my college. She started asking me five questions which looked so easy but I failed to answer the three of them. Actually I only could answer the first one and I was lucky for the second one. I could cheat if I wanted to answer the last three questions but that would make me bad so I decided to give up instead. The woman who interviewed me was very nice. She let me to think before answer and the time was enough to cheat but no, I wouldn’t try to do it. Finally, in the end of the interview she said that I would get a new e-mail later whether I failed or got the internship.

And yeah, I failed. How could Google accept someone like me who couldn’t answer easy peasy five questions which were only about basic algorithm and programming. I wouldn’t blame my college who only taught me the very beginner level of C++, it was just me who didn’t want to improve myself. Besides, I doubted myself that I couldn’t make it even when the interview wasn’t started yet. Sigh, I wish I don’t get blacklisted because of my stupidity and I will try again to apply later. Please open an internship position in product designer, Google!
