# Some Ambitious Stuffs I Did and The International Office of Padjadjaran University

Another story of me being an intern! This is a special case tho. When I was already in Jakarta working for Kargo, I tried to apply for International Office of Padjadjaran University internship. It seemed cool, besides that I was very ambitious at that time. I applied to be APYouthS ambassador and for Campuspedia internship. I also accepted the offer from someone who wanted me to work on making online courses about AI via Packt.

I failed to get all in one time. That’s why I also said in [this post](../02/the-most-outstanding-student-goes-wrong.md) that sometimes I should give up on my dreams because I only had one body. One body was tired enough to work for Kargo, yet I wished to get those too.

I didn’t complete the application for APYouthS because it required an essay. It’s not that I couldn’t write but I really didn’t have time! I would like to say this too for The Most Outstanding Student Contest too. I passed the first stage of Campuspedia internship recruitment but because I didn’t check my e-mail, I didn’t see that announcement and when I saw it, I felt I couldn’t do the requirements of the final stage on time. The requirements were quite hard though so it would take some time to finish it.

The Packt offer one, I had some problems too but I still managed to submit it. That person from Packt asked me to record a video with my voice about my profile and a simple Hello World programming tutorial. He said that I should use OBS video editor but damn I didn’t understand anything about it so I tricked the recording. I recorded my voice using my phone’s voice recorder and I edited the video using my favorite video editor, Wondershare Filmora. For the presentation I only had to save each slide into images and put the images in the order based on my voice recording. Some people said that OBS video editor was actually the easiest video editor for people who wanted to broadcast live. I just had to record my voice and play the presentation they said. But there was no time to understand a new software so yeah whatever. After that person received my video, he offered me some course topics that I could choose but until now I hadn’t replied him which courses that I wanted. I assumed he would forget me anyway.

Wow what a long story to tell huh? Nah, it hasn’t finished. Back to the International Office of Padjadjaran University internship again. It was easy to apply there and later I got an e-mail to do an interview session. Because I was in Jakarta, Senior Rhe, who was the general manager of the interns, contacted me and we did the interview session via Skype video call. I was nervous but luckily I was chosen because I thought my answers were good.

Several days later, they were having the first meeting with the interns but again, because I was still in Jakarta so I couldn’t come. There were Adinnov and Abdurrahman who were chosen as the graphic designer interns like me. We didn’t even start anything but Abdurrahman said he quitted, so there were only me and Adinnov. Because Adinnov came in the first meeting so he got the direct order from dr. Ronny, the head of International Office of Padjadjaran University, to make designs for Summer Program. Summer Program was one of the annual programs that International Office of Padjadjaran University had. Damn I’m tired writing “International Office of Padjadjaran University”, I will shorten this company name into IO in the next time I say these words.

I didn’t meet dr. Ronny in the next meeting, which was today, but I got design orders from Senior Haura. She didn’t introduce herself and only said that she was responsible for graphic designer interns but let’s say that she was my supervisor in this internship season. She told me that I should create designs for IO’s social media posts. It was a good order for me. I designed some templates for the publication posts and 3x1 posts as the new designs concept’s divider. The divider said “What’s new” to imply that we would use the new designs concept start from the divider. Here’s the divider design.

For the templates, there were news and event templates. I used the graphics from Undraw.co website. That website is so damn cool, you should see it! I was also ordered to design the interns’ ID card but I haven’t made it yet so I can’t share it now.

That’s my story as the intern in IO, hope this will be a good experience for me.
