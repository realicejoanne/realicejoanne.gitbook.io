# Finally, Jatinangor

Finally I went back again to Jatinangor. I missed three weeks of college classes LOL but I was still lucky there wasn't any surprises like quizzes or hard homework. Because I missed a lot of things, I had to do some college stuffs faster so that I wouldn't get a problem with the lecturers. By the way, I had a problem with Senior Ojan too but it was finally ended guys. Yeah it didn't end so well but I believed that was the right choice. Sorry for everyone, including Senior Ojan himself. I didn't want to be a burden for everyone anymore.

Well I think that's all I could tell. Ah yeah I hope the off-site internship mode will be good too because I was actually too stupid when I asked for this internship extension. I've told it before in the [previous post](kargo-season-2.md). Dear God, please make Tiffany always in her good mood.
