# Strangers Strike Again

Although we didn't pass the final stage of KataHack, we were still curious about NLP stuffs. Yulia shared a link of [Indosat HackData](https://hackdata.indosatooredoo-innovation.com/) competition which was kinda similar with KataHack competition. Actually it wasn't about NLP, but it was more like data mining. We met up in Moonyoo restaurant and discussed about the idea we wanted to propose. We discussed it for one night and since Moonyoo didn't have electric plugs and my laptop was died so we continued the discussion in Yulia's notebook.

The idea wasn't ripe yet so we didn't start to make the presentation slides at that time. We arranged for the next meetup but I had tight schedules this week from going for Icompas, the graduation day, and to bring back the macbook to Kargo office in Jakarta. The other team members were also quiet busy as well. When I asked for our discussions in Yulia's notebook, she couldn't show it to us because she was in Bandung and she left the notebook. The due date was near and we couldn't meet up anymore this week so we gave up on this competition. We never regret all the moments we had before and still keep the multichat. Yulia and Eres finished their seminar \(as one of the requirements for thesis defense\) not longer after those days and we celebrated it in the chats.
