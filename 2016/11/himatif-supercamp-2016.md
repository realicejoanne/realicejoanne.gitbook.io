# Himatif Supercamp 2016

Today my generation Cyber 2016 are going to Bumi Kahyangan Adventure Camp. For camping? Nah, you’re wrong. It’s not an ordinary camping but a super-camp! That’s why the event name is Himatif Supercamp 2016. Actually I had to admit that the ‘camp’ thing didn’t suit with the event. Just some leadership training and one day event, no sleeping over there.

So all who participated this event had to gather in BNI’s gate and go to the venue together. The journey to the venue was so fun! We had to cross PaUn \(Pasar Unpad\) or Padjadjaran University Market which is only opened every Sunday near Padjadjaran University. The route was not smooth, it’s full of rocks and bends. The best of all, we experienced it by motorcycles so we could feel it lively LOL.

Finally when we reached the venue, we were welcomed by some traditional music and fresh air. We sat on a bamboo mat and the event started. There were two speakers who gave the leadership training. Blah, I forgot their names and who cares about it. After that, we ate katsu fried rice from the committees and I really liked it since my favorite food is fried rice. Yeah I just remembered well the food, please forgive me. Then my generation Cyber 2016 plus my seniors Binary 2015 and Assembly 2014 were grouped for a discussion about what we had to improve in Himatif. Himatif is Student Association of Informatics Engineering in Padjadjaran University btw. First we had to think the problems we had, then think about the solutions, and finally choose some possible-to-do solutions that we made.

Finally the event was ended. We went back home with motorcycles again but it’s not as fun as before because it was rainy. That’s all for today. Bye!
