# Come Back Home

Today I finally come back home after about 4 months living in my temporary home. But actually I didn’t plan to come back today, it’s just because I didn’t want to come back home alone. Yeah, I came back home to Jakarta with Rey who lives near my neighborhood so I could be in the same bus with him and also Abie who wanted to go to the airport in Jakarta. Fyi, Abie himself want to join Rey and me just yesterday. Very suddenly, worse than I who also just plan to come back home only two days before.

So basically I’d already asked Rey several times about when would he come back home and he always said “I don’t know.” That’s why I underestimated everything and hadn’t washed dishes and clothes. Then suddenly Rey finally decided: two days before today! WTF I was so confused. I even thought to come back home with another friends but most of them also went home in the same day like Rey and me. Ugh, so in only two days I prepared everything including cleaning my room and doing my calculus homework. I only could leave all my dirty clothes hadn’t been washed when my father told me to clean everything before leaving.

And finally the day is coming. Before that, I had to come to my campus to collect my calculus homework. Then Rey, Abie, and I went together to the bus stop. When our Primajasa bus arrived, we went inside and searched for the empty seats. I had to admit we were so unlucky to come back home today because the bus was almost full OMG. I didn’t want to come back home alone because I wanted to be near someone who I know. But you know, we almost didn’t get any empty seat so we just get seats randomly. Yeah not so unlucky, we arrived in Jakarta only in four hours and in the exact time for lunch. After we got the final bus stop, we were separated to our own destination. Rey’s house was near with the Primajasa bus stop so he just walked to get his house. Abie wanted to go to the airport so he searched for a taxi. And I had to take a public car \(angkot\) to get my house.

Finally I reached my house. I ate my McD fried chickens and went to my lovely room. OMG my room was so clean! All of my things were moved. Even now my table drawers were full of my sister Jessica’s school books. Yeah I didn’t care because I was too tired to think okay I took a very long nap until night came. Hello again my house and my family!
