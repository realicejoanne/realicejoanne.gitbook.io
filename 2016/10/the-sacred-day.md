# The Sacred Day

This day was the worst and the best day for our generation Cyber 2016. Today we got much anger from my seniors because actually our generation hadn’t already been ready for being legitimated as the next generation of Informatics Engineering in Padjadjaran University. We had a lot of mistakes, such as didn’t do some tasks from seniors, didn’t join all CBS time, didn’t bring the CBS attributes, etc. Fyi, CBS is Character Building Season, the name of student orientation in Padjadjaran’s Informatics Engineering.

There were a lot of dramas between seniors and the CBS committees. They were arguing about what they supposed to do with us because our mistakes were too much. They were also shouting each other and crying a lot in that time. After those dramatic sessions, we had to close our eyes and hurray we got legitimated.
