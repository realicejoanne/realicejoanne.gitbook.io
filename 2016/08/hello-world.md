# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog!

WTF what am I doing right now? Making new personal blog while I have two more blogs not being active -,-

Actually I just want to be popular by blogging here about my experience as a college student in Unpad LOL. So please enjoy my upcoming posts about me joining some student associations \(himpunan mahasiswa\), competitions, etc. and also some programming materials I got from lectures. If you want to read my rants about my friends, my love, my school, etc. you can go to this [blog](http://realicejoanne.blogspot.com). And if you want to read my works such as short stories, unfinished novels, etc. you can check this [blog](http://alicetheuglyducklingsdiary.blogspot.com/).

> **I was always open to everyone** but not now sorry. I had to make those blogs private because I just didn't like to see my past. Also those blogs were kinda messy and very unorganized since I was in college so I didn't know if I would come back again to those blogs.

Btw do you know how much I struggle to write this post? I’m not a good English speaker so I hope you still understand what I’m writing here. Yeah count this as a practice for my future. Okay see you in my next post!
