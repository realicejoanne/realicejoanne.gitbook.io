# Quick Introduction of Padjadjaran’s Informatics Engineering

Just like [my blog](http://blogs.unpad.ac.id/realicejoanne/)’s name, a blog by Padjadjaran’s Informatics Engineering scholar and so I am. I’ve just gotten here this year sooo yes I’m a junior right now. I hope in this major I can have a lot of good experiences and I can be proud to myself. As you know, this major is one of new majors in Padjadjaran University and it just had 5 generations included this year. Precisely, Padjadjaran’s Informatics Engineering started from 2012 and had its own association \(himpunan\) by December 22th, 2013. So far, this major has a B accreditation. It’s one of a great achievement since this major is new and doesn’t have a lot of alumni. \(Usually new majors only get C accreditation.\)

I hope by years this major gets a better accreditation and of course its own faculty! Yeah, this major is still in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty in Padjadjaran University while most of universities in Indonesia have this major in Engineering Faculty. Padjadjaran University doesn’t have its own Engineering Faculty, so this is one of our dream. Me and all of the students who taking this major included my seniors. Beside of that, we also hope that we have our own buildings for lecturing activities and practicum. Ah, too much talking about our dreams LOL. I almost forget to tell some quick introductions about this major. So, here it is.

Padjadjaran’s Study Program of Informatics Engineering aims to produce graduates who are able to absorb, apply and develop IT with core competencies in Software Engineering, includes four specialization studies namely **Information Systems**, **Computer Networks and Data Communications**, **Intelligent Systems and Computer Graphics** and **Computing** and **Numerical Methods**. Actually, for Numerical Methods is not available again for the next years because the participants who chose this specialization aren’t much. Those specialization studies can be chosen when you reach fifth semester.

IT graduates expected to develop software for a variety of purposes, conduct an analysis of the system in an agency, create solutions integrated by utilizing the software, able to plan and evaluate the application of IT in an organization, capable of designing and maintaining a database including data warehouse for an agency or company, capable of testing the functions of the software, capable of developing, designing and building and maintaining websites with a wide range of services and amenities.

Okay, forgive me quoting those two paragraphs from [this site](http://www.unpad.ac.id/fakultas/matematika-ipa/teknik-informatika) hehe. I’m not expert writing difficult terms used. Because this is a quick introduction, so that’s all! Don’t worry, I’ll tell you more later. There are still four years to explain all about this major.
