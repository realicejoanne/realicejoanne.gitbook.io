# \(This should be\) Categories

I’m posting this just for more introductions from previous post. Today I want to tell about categories of my upcoming posts.

> But because I just realize that Gitbook doesn't support categories or tags... umm... okay let's forget the categories. I also planned not to include categories anymore since I didn't really want people read all of my posts here. I want people find my blog posts not by searching from the categories but from my [personal website](https://realicejoanne.github.io/).

Just praying I’m not dead so I can post more here. Bye.
